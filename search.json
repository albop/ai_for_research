    "section": "Ordered Collections",
    "text": "Ordered Collections\n\nLists\nA Python list is an ordered collection of items.\nWe can create lists using the following syntax\n\n[item1, item2, ...,  itemN]\n\nwhere the ... represents any number of additional items.\nEach item can be of any type.\nLet’s create some lists.\n\n# created, but not assigned to a variable\n[2.0, 9.1, 12.5]\n\n\n# stored as the variable `x`\nx = [2.0, 9.1, 12.5]\nprint(\"x has type\", type(x))\nx\n\n\nWhat Can We Do with Lists?\nWe can access items in a list called mylist using mylist[N] where N is an integer.\nNote: Anytime that we use the syntax x[i] we are doing what is called indexing – it means that we are selecting a particular element of a collection x.\n\nx[1]\n\nWait? Why did x[1] return 9.1 when the first element in x is actually 2.0?\nThis happened because Python starts counting at zero!\nLets repeat that one more time for emphasis Python starts counting at zero!\nTo access the first element of x we must use x[0]:\n\nx[0]\n\nWe can also determine how many items are in a list using the len function.\n\nlen(x)\n\nWhat happens if we try to index with a number higher than the number of items in a list?\n\n# uncomment the line below and run\n# x[4]\n\nWe can check if a list contains an element using the in keyword.\n\n2.0 in x\n\n\n1.5 in x\n\nFor our list x, other common operations we might want to do are…\n\nx.reverse()\nx\n\n\nnumber_list = [10, 25, 42, 1.0]\nprint(number_list)\nnumber_list.sort()\nprint(number_list)\n\nNote that in order to sort, we had to have all elements in our list be numbers (int and float), more on this below.\nWe could actually do the same with a list of strings. In this case, sort will put the items in alphabetical order.\n\nstr_list = [\"NY\", \"AZ\", \"TX\"]\nprint(str_list)\nstr_list.sort()\nprint(str_list)\n\nThe append method adds an element to the end of existing list.\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.append(10)\nprint(num_list)\n\nHowever, if you call append with a list, it adds a list to the end, rather than the numbers in that list.\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.append([20, 4])\nprint(num_list)\n\nTo combine the lists instead…\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.extend([20, 4])\nprint(num_list)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 1 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\n\nLists of Different Types\nWhile most examples above have all used a list with a single type of variable, this is not required.\nLet’s carefully make a small change to the first example: replace 2.0 with 2\n\nx = [2, 9.1, 12.5]\n\nThis behavior is identical for many operations you might apply to a list.\n\nimport numpy as np\nx = [2, 9.1, 12.5]\nnp.mean(x) == sum(x)/len(x)\n\nHere we have also introduced a new module, Numpy, which provides many functions for working with numeric data.\nTaking this further, we can put completely different types of elements inside of a list.\n\n# stored as the variable `x`\nx = [2, \"hello\", 3.0]\nprint(\"x has type\", type(x))\nx\n\nTo see the types of individual elements in the list:\n\nprint(f\"type(x[0]) = {type(x[0])}, type(x[1]) = {type(x[1])}, type(x[2]) = {type(x[2])}\")\n\nWhile no programming limitations prevent this, you should be careful if you write code with different numeric and non-numeric types in the same list.\nFor example, if the types within the list cannot be compared, then how could you sort the elements of the list? (i.e. How do you determine whether the string “hello” is less than the integer 2, “hello” &lt; 2?)\n\nx = [2, \"hello\", 3.0]\n# uncomment the line below and see what happens!\n# x.sort()\n\nA few key exceptions to this general rule are:\n\nLists with both integers and floating points are less error-prone (since mathematical code using the list would work with both types).\n\nWhen working with lists and data, you may want to represent missing values with a different type than the existing values.\n\n\n\nThe range Function\nOne function you will see often in Python is the range function.\nIt has three versions:\n\nrange(N): goes from 0 to N-1\n\nrange(a, N): goes from a to N-1\n\nrange(a, N, d): goes from a to N-1, counting by d\n\nWhen we call the range function, we get back something that has type range:\n\nr = range(5)\nprint(\"type(r)\", type(r))\n\nTo turn the range into a list:\n\nlist(r)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 2 in the exercise list.\n\n\nWhat are Tuples?\nTuples are very similar to lists and hold ordered collections of items.\nHowever, tuples and lists have three main differences:\n\nTuples are created using parenthesis — ( and ) — instead of square brackets — [ and ].\n\nTuples are immutable, which is a fancy computer science word meaning that they can’t be changed or altered after they are created.\n\nTuples and multiple return values from functions are tightly connected, as we will see in functions.\n\n\nt = (1, \"hello\", 3.0)\nprint(\"t is a\", type(t))\nt\n\nWe can convert a list to a tuple by calling the tuple function on a list.\n\nprint(\"x is a\", type(x))\nprint(\"tuple(x) is a\", type(tuple(x)))\ntuple(x)\n\nWe can also convert a tuple to a list using the list function.\n\nlist(t)\n\nAs with a list, we access items in a tuple t using t[N] where N is an int.\n\nt[0]  # still start counting at 0\n\n\nt[2]\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 3 in the exercise list.\nTuples (and lists) can be unpacked directly into variables.\n\nx, y = (1, \"test\")\nprint(f\"x = {x}, y = {y}\")\n\nThis will be a convenient way to work with functions returning multiple values, as well as within comprehensions and loops.\n\n\nList vs Tuple: Which to Use?\nShould you use a list or tuple?\nThis depends on what you are storing, whether you might need to reorder the elements, or whether you’d add new elements without a complete reinterpretation of the underlying data.\nFor example, take data representing the GDP (in trillions) and population (in billions) for China in 2015.\n\nchina_data_2015 = (\"China\", 2015, 11.06, 1.371)\n\nprint(china_data_2015)\n\nIn this case, we have used a tuple since: (a) ordering would be meaningless; and (b) adding more data would require a reinterpretation of the whole data structure.\nOn the other hand, consider a list of GDP in China between 2013 and 2015.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nprint(gdp_data)\n\nIn this case, we have used a list, since adding on a new element to the end of the list for GDP in 2016 would make complete sense.\nAlong these lines, collecting data on China for different years may make sense as a list of tuples (e.g. year, GDP, and population – although we will see better ways to store this sort of data in the Pandas section).\n\nchina_data = [(2015, 11.06, 1.371), (2014, 10.48, 1.364), (2013, 9.607, 1.357)]\nprint(china_data)\n\nIn general, a rule of thumb is to use a list unless you need to use a tuple.\nKey criteria for tuple use are when you want to:\n\nensure the order of elements can’t change\n\nensure the actual values of the elements can’t change\n\nuse the collection as a key in a dict (we will learn what this means soon)\n\n\n\nzip and enumerate\nTwo functions that can be extremely useful are zip and enumerate.\nBoth of these functions are best understood by example, so let’s see them in action and then talk about what they do.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nyears = [2013, 2014, 2015]\nz = zip(years, gdp_data)\nprint(\"type(z)\", type(z))\n\nTo see what is inside z, let’s convert it to a list.\n\nlist(z)\n\nNotice that we now have a list where each item is a tuple.\nWithin each tuple, we have one item from each of the collections we passed to the zip function.\nIn particular, the first item in z contains the first item from [2013, 2014, 2015] and the first item from [9.607, 10.48, 11.06].\nThe second item in z contains the second item from each collection and so on.\nWe can access an element in this and then unpack the resulting tuple directly into variables.\n\nl = list(zip(years, gdp_data))\nx, y = l[0]\nprint(f\"year = {x}, GDP = {y}\")\n\nNow let’s experiment with enumerate.\n\ne = enumerate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\nprint(\"type(e)\", type(e))\ne\n\nAgain, we call list(e) to see what is inside.\n\nlist(e)\n\nWe again have a list of tuples, but this time, the first element in each tuple is the index of the second tuple element in the initial collection.\nNotice that the third item is (2, 'c') because [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"][2] is 'c'\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 4 in the exercise list.\nAn important quirk of some iterable types that are not lists (such as the above zip) is that you cannot convert the same type to a list twice.\nThis is because zip, enumerate, and range produce what is called a generator.\nA generator will only produce each of its elements a single time, so if you call list on the same generator a second time, it will not have any elements to iterate over anymore.\nFor more information, refer to the Python documentation.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nyears = [2013, 2014, 2015]\nz = zip(years, gdp_data)\nl = list(z)\nprint(l)\nm = list(z)\nprint(m)"

    "text": "Associative Collections\n\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary (or dict) associates keys with values.\nIt will feel similar to a dictionary for words, where the keys are words and the values are the associated definitions.\nThe most common way to create a dict is to use curly braces — { and } — like this:\n\n{\"key1\": value1, \"key2\": value2, ..., \"keyN\": valueN}\n\nwhere the ... indicates that we can have any number of additional terms.\nThe crucial part of the syntax is that each key-value pair is written key: value and that these pairs are separated by commas — ,.\nLet’s see an example using our aggregate data on China in 2015.\n\nchina_data = {\"country\": \"China\", \"year\": 2015, \"GDP\" : 11.06, \"population\": 1.371}\nprint(china_data)\n\nUnlike our above example using a tuple, a dict allows us to associate a name with each field, rather than having to remember the order within the tuple.\nOften, code that makes a dict is easier to read if we put each key: value pair on its own line. (Recall our earlier comment on using whitespace effectively to improve readability!)\nThe code below is equivalent to what we saw above.\n\nchina_data = {\n    \"country\": \"China\",\n    \"year\": 2015,\n    \"GDP\" : 11.06,\n    \"population\": 1.371\n}\n\nMost often, the keys (e.g. “country”, “year”, “GDP”, and “population”) will be strings, but we could also use numbers (int, or float) or even tuples (or, rarely, a combination of types).\nThe values can be any type and different from each other.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list.\nThis next example is meant to emphasize how values can be anything – including another dictionary.\n\ncompanies = {\"AAPL\": {\"bid\": 175.96, \"ask\": 175.98},\n             \"GE\": {\"bid\": 1047.03, \"ask\": 1048.40},\n             \"TVIX\": {\"bid\": 8.38, \"ask\": 8.40}}\nprint(companies)\n\n\nGetting, Setting, and Updating dict Items\nWe can now ask Python to tell us the value for a particular key by using the syntax d[k], where d is our dict and k is the key for which we want to find the value.\nFor example,\n\nprint(china_data[\"year\"])\nprint(f\"country = {china_data['country']}, population = {china_data['population']}\")\n\nNote: when inside of a formatting string, you can use ' instead of \" as above to ensure the formatting still works with the embedded code.\nIf we ask for the value of a key that is not in the dict, we will get an error.\n\n# uncomment the line below to see the error\n# china_data[\"inflation\"]\n\nWe can also add new items to a dict using the syntax d[new_key] = new_value.\nLet’s see some examples.\n\nprint(china_data)\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = \"4.05%\"\nprint(china_data)\n\nTo update the value, we use assignment in the same way (which will create the key and value as required).\n\nprint(china_data)\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = \"4.051%\"\nprint(china_data)\n\nOr we could change the type.\n\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = 4.051\nprint(china_data)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 6 in the exercise list.\n\n\nCommon dict Functionality\nWe can do some common things with dicts.\nWe will demonstrate them with examples below.\n\n# number of key-value pairs in a dict\nlen(china_data)\n\n\n# get a list of all the keys\nlist(china_data.keys())\n\n\n# get a list of all the values\nlist(china_data.values())\n\n\nmore_china_data = {\"irrigated_land\": 690_070, \"top_religions\": {\"buddhist\": 18.2, \"christian\" : 5.1, \"muslim\": 1.8}}\n\n# Add all key-value pairs in mydict2 to mydict.\n# if the key already appears in mydict, overwrite the\n# value with the value in mydict2\nchina_data.update(more_china_data)\nchina_data\n\n\n# Get the value associated with a key or return a default value\n# use this to avoid the NameError we saw above if you have a reasonable\n# default value\nchina_data.get(\"irrigated_land\", \"Data Not Available\")\n\n\nchina_data.get(\"death_rate\", \"Data Not Available\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 7 in the exercise list.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 8 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\nSets (Optional)\nPython has an additional way to represent collections of items: sets.\nSets come up infrequently, but you should be aware of them.\nIf you are familiar with the mathematical concept of sets, then you will understand the majority of Python sets already.\nIf you don’t know the math behind sets, don’t worry: we’ll cover the basics of Python’s sets here.\nA set is an unordered collection of unique elements.\nThe syntax for creating a set uses curly bracket { and }.\n\n{item1, item2, ..., itemN}\n\nHere is an example.\n\ns = {1, \"hello\", 3.0}\nprint(\"s has type\", type(s))\ns\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 9 in the exercise list.\nAs with lists and tuples, we can check if something is in the set and check the set’s length:\n\nprint(\"len(s) =\", len(s))\n\"hello\" in s\n\nUnlike lists and tuples, we can’t extract elements of a set s using s[N] where N is a number.\n\n# Uncomment the line below to see what happens\n# s[1]\n\nThis is because sets are not ordered, so the notion of getting the second element (s[1]) is not well defined.\nWe add elements to a set s using s.add.\n\ns.add(100)\ns\n\n\ns.add(\"hello\") # nothing happens, why?\ns\n\nWe can also do set operations.\nConsider the set s from above and the set s2 = {\"hello\", \"world\"}.\n\ns.union(s2): returns a set with all elements in either s or s2\n\ns.intersection(s2): returns a set with all elements in both s and s2\n\ns.difference(s2): returns a set with all elements in s that aren’t in s2\n\ns.symmetric_difference(s2): returns a set with all elements in only one of s and s2\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 10 in the exercise list.\nAs with tuples and lists, a set function can convert other collections to sets.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 1]\nset(x)\n\n\nt = (1, 2, 3, 1)\nset(t)\n\nLikewise, we can convert sets to lists and tuples.\n\nlist(s)\n\n\ntuple(s)"

    "section": "How to Define (Python) Functions?",
    "text": "How to Define (Python) Functions?\nThe basic syntax to create our own function is as follows:\n\ndef function_name(inputs):\n    # step 1\n    # step 2\n    # ...\n    return outputs\n\nHere we see two new keywords: def and return.\n\ndef is used to tell Python we would like to define a new function.\n\nreturn is used to tell Python what we would like to return from a function.\n\nLet’s look at an example and then discuss each part:\n\ndef mean(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    N = len(numbers)\n    answer = total / N\n\n    return answer\n\nHere we defined a function mean that has one input (numbers), does three steps, and has one output (answer).\nLet’s see what happens when we call this function on the list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nthe_mean = mean(x)\nthe_mean\n\nAdditionally, as we saw in the control flow lecture, indentation controls blocks of code (along with the scope rules).\nTo see this, compare a function with no inputs or return values.\n\ndef f():\n    print(\"1\")\n    print(\"2\")\nf()\n\nWith the following change of indentation…\n\ndef f():\n    print(\"1\")\nprint(\"2\")\nf()\n\n\n\nScope\nNotice that we named the input to the function x and we called the output the_mean.\nWhen we defined the function, the input was called numbers and the output answer… what gives?\nThis is an example of a programming concept called variable scope.\nIn Python, functions define their own scope for variables.\nIn English, this means that regardless of what name we give an input variable (x in this example), the input will always be referred to as numbers inside the body of the mean function.\nIt also means that although we called the output answer inside of the function mean, that this variable name was only valid inside of our function.\nTo use the output of the function, we had to give it our own name (the_mean in this example).\nAnother point to make here is that the intermediate variables we defined inside mean (total and N) are only defined inside of the mean function – we can’t access them from outside. We can verify this by trying to see what the value of total is:\n\ndef mean(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    N = len(numbers)\n    answer = total / N\n    return answer # or directly return total / N\n\n# uncomment the line below and execute to see the error\n# total\n\nThis point can be taken even further: the same name can be bound to variables inside of blocks of code and in the outer “scope”.\n\nx = 4\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\ndef f():\n    x = 5 # a different \"x\"\n    print(f\"x = {x}\")\nf() # calls function\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nThe final point we want to make about scope is that function inputs and output don’t have to be given a name outside the function.\n\nmean([10, 20, 30])\n\nNotice that we didn’t name the input or the output, but the function was called successfully.\nNow, we’ll use our new knowledge to define a function which computes the output from a Cobb-Douglas production function with parameters $ z = 1 $ and $ = 0.33 $ and takes inputs $ K $ and $ L $.\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L):\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n    alpha = 0.33\n\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\nWe can use this function as we did the mean function.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nRe-using Functions\nEconomists are often interested in this question: how much does output change if we modify our inputs?\nFor example, take a production function $ Y_1 = F(K_1,L_1) $ which produces $ Y_1 $ units of the goods.\nIf we then multiply the inputs each by $ \\(, so that\\) K_2 = K_1 $ and $ L_2 = L_1 $, then the output is\n\\[\nY_2 = F(K_2, L_2) = F(\\gamma K_1, \\gamma L_1)\n\\]\nHow does $ Y_1 $ compare to $ Y_2 $?\nAnswering this question involves something called returns to scale.\nReturns to scale tells us whether our inputs are more or less productive as we have more of them.\nFor example, imagine that you run a restaurant. How would you expect the amount of food you could produce would change if you could build an exact replica of your restaurant and kitchen and hire the same number of cooks and waiters? You would probably expect it to double.\nIf, for any $ K, L $, we multiply $ K, L $ by a value $ $ then\n\nIf $ &lt; $ then we say the production function has decreasing returns to scale.\n\nIf $ = $ then we say the production function has constant returns to scale.\n\nIf $ &gt; $ then we say the production function has increasing returns to scale.\n\nLet’s try it and see what our function is!\n\ny1 = cobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\nprint(y1)\ny2 = cobb_douglas(2*1.0, 2*0.5)\nprint(y2)\n\nHow did $ Y_1 $ and $ Y_2 $ relate?\n\ny2 / y1\n\n$ Y_2 $ was exactly double $ Y_1 $!\nLet’s write a function that will compute the returns to scale for different values of $ K $ and $ L $.\nThis is an example of how writing functions can allow us to re-use code in ways we might not originally anticipate. (You didn’t know we’d be writing a returns_to_scale function when we wrote cobb_douglas.)\n\ndef returns_to_scale(K, L, gamma):\n    y1 = cobb_douglas(K, L)\n    y2 = cobb_douglas(gamma*K, gamma*L)\n    y_ratio = y2 / y1\n    return y_ratio / gamma\n\n\nreturns_to_scale(1.0, 0.5, 2.0)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 1 in the exercise list.\nIt turns out that with a little bit of algebra, we can check that this will always hold for our Cobb-Douglas example above.\nTo show this, take an arbitrary $ K, L $ and multiply the inputs by an arbitrary $ $.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    F(\\gamma K, \\gamma L) &= z (\\gamma K)^{\\alpha} (\\gamma L)^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    &=  z \\gamma^{\\alpha}\\gamma^{1-\\alpha} K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    &= \\gamma z K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha} = \\gamma F(K, L)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor an example of a production function that is not CRS, look at a generalization of the Cobb-Douglas production function that has different “output elasticities” for the 2 inputs.\n\\[\nY = z K^{\\alpha_1} L^{\\alpha_2}\n\\]\nNote that if $ _2 = 1 - _1 $, this is our Cobb-Douglas production function.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 2 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\nMultiple Returns\nAnother valuable element to analyze on production functions is how output changes as we change only one of the inputs. We will call this the marginal product.\nFor example, compare the output using $ K, L $ units of inputs to that with an $ $ units of labor.\nThen the marginal product of labor (MPL) is defined as\n\\[\n\\frac{F(K, L + \\varepsilon) - F(K, L)}{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\nThis tells us how much additional output is created relative to the additional input. (Spoiler alert: This should look like the definition for a partial derivative!)\nIf the input can be divided into small units, then we can use calculus to take this limit, using the partial derivative of the production function relative to that input.\nIn this case, we define the marginal product of labor (MPL) and marginal product of capital (MPK) as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMPL(K, L) &= \\frac{\\partial F(K, L)}{\\partial L}\\\\\nMPK(K, L) &= \\frac{\\partial F(K, L)}{\\partial K}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the Cobb-Douglas example above, this becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMPK(K, L) &= z  \\alpha \\left(\\frac{K}{L} \\right)^{\\alpha - 1}\\\\\nMPL(K, L) &= (1-\\alpha) z \\left(\\frac{K}{L} \\right)^{\\alpha}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet’s test it out with Python! We’ll also see that we can actually return multiple things in a Python function.\nThe syntax for a return statement with multiple items is return item1, item2, ….\nIn this case, we’ll compute both the MPL and the MPK and then return both.\n\ndef marginal_products(K, L, epsilon):\n\n    mpl = (cobb_douglas(K, L + epsilon) - cobb_douglas(K, L)) / epsilon\n    mpk = (cobb_douglas(K + epsilon, L) - cobb_douglas(K, L)) / epsilon\n\n    return mpl, mpk\n\n\ntup = marginal_products(1.0, 0.5,  1e-4)\nprint(tup)\n\nInstead of using the tuple, these can be directly unpacked to variables.\n\nmpl, mpk = marginal_products(1.0, 0.5,  1e-4)\nprint(f\"mpl = {mpl}, mpk = {mpk}\")\n\nWe can use this to calculate the marginal products for different K, fixing L using a comprehension.\n\nKs = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n[marginal_products(K, 0.5, 1e-4) for K in Ks] # create a tuple for each K\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nIn a previous exercise, we asked you to find help for the cobb_douglas and returns_to_scale functions using ?.\nIt didn’t provide any useful information.\nTo provide this type of help information, we need to add what Python programmers call a “docstring” to our functions.\nThis is done by putting a string (not assigned to any variable name) as the first line of the body of the function (after the line with def).\nBelow is a new version of the template we used to define functions.\n\ndef function_name(inputs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Docstring\n    \"\"\"\n    # step 1\n    # step 2\n    # ...\n    return outputs\n\nLet’s re-define our cobb_douglas function to include a docstring.\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the production F(K, L) for a Cobb-Douglas production function\n\n    Takes the form F(K, L) = z K^{\\alpha} L^{1 - \\alpha}\n\n    We restrict z = 1 and alpha = 0.33\n    \"\"\"\n    return 1.0 * K**(0.33) * L**(1.0 - 0.33)\n\nNow when we have Jupyter evaluate cobb_douglas?, our message is displayed (or use the Contextual Help window with Jupyterlab and Ctrl-I or Cmd-I).\n\ncobb_douglas?\n\nWe recommend that you always include at least a very simple docstring for nontrivial functions.\nThis is in the same spirit as adding comments to your code — it makes it easier for future readers/users (including yourself) to understand what the code does.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 3 in the exercise list.\n\n\nDefault and Keyword Arguments\nFunctions can have optional arguments.\nTo accomplish this, we must these arguments a default value by saying name=default_value instead of just name as we list the arguments.\nTo demonstrate this functionality, let’s now make $ z $ and $ $ arguments to our cobb_douglas function!\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L, alpha=0.33, z=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the production F(K, L) for a Cobb-Douglas production function\n\n    Takes the form F(K, L) = z K^{\\alpha} L^{1 - \\alpha}\n    \"\"\"\n    return z * K**(alpha) * L**(1.0 - alpha)\n\nWe can now call this function by passing in just K and L. Notice that it will produce same result as earlier because alpha and z are the same as earlier.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\nHowever, we can also set the other arguments of the function by passing more than just K/L.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, 0.35, 1.6)\n\nIn the example above, we used alpha = 0.35, z = 1.6.\nWe can also refer to function arguments by their name, instead of only their position (order).\nTo do this, we would write func_name(arg=value) for as many of the arguments as we want.\nHere’s how to do that with our cobb_douglas example.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, z = 1.5)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 4 in the exercise list.\nIn terms of variable scope, the z name within the function is different from any other z in the outer scope.\nTo be clear,\n\nx = 5\ndef f(x):\n    return x\nf(x) # \"coincidence\" that it has the same name\n\nThis is also true with named function arguments, above.\n\nz = 1.5\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, z = z) # no problem!\n\nIn that example, the z on the left hand side of z = z refers to the local variable name in the function whereas the z on the right hand side refers to the z in the outer scope.\n\n\nAside: Methods\nAs we learned earlier, all variables in Python have a type associated with them.\nDifferent types of variables have different functions or operations defined for them.\nFor example, I can divide one number by another or make a string uppercase.\nIt wouldn’t make sense to divide one string by another or make a number uppercase.\nWhen certain functionality is closely tied to the type of an object, it is often implemented as a special kind of function known as a method.\nFor now, you only need to know two things about methods:\n\nWe call them by doing variable.method_name(other_arguments) instead of function_name(variable, other_arguments).\n\nA method is a function, even though we call it using a different notation.\n\nWhen we introduced the core data types, we saw many methods defined on these types.\nLet’s revisit them for the str, or string type.\nNotice that we call each of these functions using the dot syntax described above.\n\ns = \"This is my handy string!\"\n\n\ns.upper()\n\n\ns.title()\n\n\n\nCreating Custom Types\nPython allows for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing you to define your own custom types and merge together some sets of parameters with custom methods. This can help you streamline your code by making it more modular.\nWe are used to defining variables like x = dict(\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2) and then using notation like x[\"a\"] to access the value of 1. We can also define our own custom types and use them in similar ways.\nFor example, a simple class that stores two variables would look like this:\n\nclass MyType:\n  def __init__(self, x, y):\n    self.x = x\n    self.y = y\n\nUsed both internal and external to classes, the __init__ method is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object’s state. The self argument refers to the object itself. The self argument is always the first argument of any method in a class. The self argument is not passed in when the method is called, but Python will pass in the object itself when the method is called.\nA class, defined by the class keyword, is a blueprint for an object. It defines the attributes and methods that an object will have. An object is an instance of a class that has been created and assigned to a variable. It is created by calling the class name as if it were a function. When you call the class name, the object is created and the __init__ method is called by default.\n\na = MyType(1, 2)\nb = MyType(3, 4)\n# Notice that these are different objects, even though they are the same type!\na == b\n\nYou can see that a and b are both instances of the MyType class by using the type function.\n\ntype(a)\n\nPoint at the debugger to see the a.x etc. fields You can access the attributes of an object using the dot notation. For example, to access the x attribute of the a object, you would use a.x.\n\nprint(f\"a.x = {a.x} and a.y = {a.y}\")\n\nIn addition to attributes, objects can also have methods. Methods are functions that are defined inside of a class. They are accessed using the dot notation as well. For example, let’s define a method that adds the x and y attributes of an object.\n\nclass MyAdder:\n  def __init__(self, x, y):\n    self.x = x\n    self.y = y\n\n  def add(self):\n    return self.x + self.y\n\nWe can now create an object of type MyAdder and call the add method, in the same way that we called methods on built-in types (like the .upper() method on a string.)\n\nb = MyAdder(1, 2)\nprint(b.add())\n\nUsing custom classes can often be a helpful way to organize your code and make it more modular, by grouping together related variables and functions. Understanding how to create and use custom classes is also a key part of understanding how Python works under the hood, and can be crucial to using some of the more advanced Python packages (like PyTorch.)\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list.",

    "text": "More on Scope (Optional)\nKeep in mind that with mathematical functions, the arguments are just dummy names that can be interchanged.\nThat is, the following are identical.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    f(K, L) &= z\\, K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    f(K_2, L_2) &= z\\, K_2^{\\alpha} L_2^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nThe same concept applies to Python functions, where the arguments are just placeholder names, and our cobb_douglas function is identical to\n\ndef cobb_douglas2(K2, L2): # changed dummy variable names\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n    alpha = 0.33\n\n    return z * K2**alpha * L2**(1 - alpha)\n\ncobb_douglas2(1.0, 0.5)\n\nThis is an appealing feature of functions for avoiding coding errors: names of variables within the function are localized and won’t clash with those on the outside (with more examples in scope).\nImportantly, when Python looks for variables matching a particular name, it begins in the most local scope.\nThat is, note that having an alpha in the outer scope does not impact the local one.\n\ndef cobb_douglas3(K, L, alpha): # added new argument\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha) # sees local argument alpha\n\nprint(cobb_douglas3(1.0, 0.5, 0.2))\nprint(\"Setting alpha, does the result change?\")\nalpha = 0.5 # in the outer scope\nprint(cobb_douglas3(1.0, 0.5, 0.2))\n\nA crucial element of the above function is that the alpha variable was available in the local scope of the function.\nConsider the alternative where it is not. We have removed the alpha function parameter as well as the local definition of alpha.\n\ndef cobb_douglas4(K, L): # added new argument\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n\n    # there are no local alpha in scope!\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\nalpha = 0.2 # in the outer scope\nprint(f\"alpha = {alpha} gives {cobb_douglas4(1.0, 0.5)}\")\nalpha = 0.3\nprint(f\"alpha = {alpha} gives {cobb_douglas4(1.0, 0.5)}\")\n\nThe intuition of scoping does not apply only for the “global” vs. “function” naming of variables, but also for nesting.\nFor example, we can define a version of cobb_douglas which is also missing a z in its inner-most scope, then put the function inside of another function.\n\nz = 1\ndef output_given_alpha(alpha):\n    # Scoping logic:\n    # 1. local function name doesn't clash with global one\n    # 2. alpha comes from the function parameter\n    # 3. z comes from the outer global scope\n    def cobb_douglas(K, L):\n        return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\n    # using this function\n    return cobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\nalpha = 100 # ignored\nalphas = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]\n# comprehension variables also have local scope\n# and don't clash with the alpha = 100\n[output_given_alpha(alpha) for alpha in alphas]",

    "text": "Net Present Values and Asset Pricing\nIn this lecture, we’ll introduce two related topics from economics:\n\nNet present valuations\n\nAsset pricing\n\nThese topics will motivate some of the programming we do in this course.\nIn economics and finance, “assets” provide a stream of payoffs.\nThese “assets” can be concrete or abstract: a stock pays dividends over time, a bond pays interest, an apple tree provides apples, a job pays wages, and an education provides possible jobs (which, in turn, pay wages).\nWhen deciding the price to pay for an asset or how to choose between different alternatives, we need to take into account that most people would prefer to receive 1 today vs. 1 next year.\nThis reflection on consumer preferences leads to the notion of a discount rate. If you are indifferent between receiving 1.00 today and 1.10 next year, then the discount rate over the next year is $ r = 0.10 $.\nIf we assume that an individuals preferences are consistent over time, then we can apply that same discount rate to valuing assets further into the future.\nFor example, we would expect that the consumer would be indifferent between consuming 1.00 today and $ (1+r)(1+r) = 1.21 $ dollars two years from now (i.e. discount twice).\nInverting this formula, 1 delivered two years from now is equivalent to $ $ today.",

    "section": "Iteration",
    "text": "Iteration\nWhen doing computations or analyzing data, we often need to repeat certain operations a finite number of times or until some condition is met.\nExamples include processing all data files in a directory (folder), aggregating revenues and costs for every period in a year, or computing the net present value of certain assets. (In fact, later in this section, we will verify the equations that we wrote down above.)\nThese are all examples of a programming concept called iteration.\nWe feel the concept is best understood through example, so we will present a contrived example and then discuss the details behind doing iteration in Python.\n\nA Contrived Example\nSuppose we wanted to print out the first 10 integers and their squares.\nWe could do something like this.\n\nprint(f\"1**2 = {1**2}\")\nprint(f\"2**2 = {2**2}\")\nprint(f\"3**2 = {3**2}\")\nprint(f\"4**2 = {4**2}\")\n# .. and so on until 10\n\nAs you can see, the code above is repetitive.\nFor each integer, the code is exactly the same except for the two places where the “current” integer appears.\nSuppose that I asked you to write the same print statement for an int stored in a variable named i.\nYou might write the following code:\n\nprint(f\"{i}**2 = {i**2}\")\n\nThis more general version of the operation suggests a strategy for achieving our goal with less repetition: have a variable i take on the values 1 through 10 (Quiz: How can we use range to create the numbers 1 to 10?) and run the line of code above for each new value of i.\nThis can be accomplished with a for loop!\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n     print(f\"{i}**2 = {i**2}\")\n\nWhoa, what just happened?\nThe integer i took on the values in range(1, 11) one by one and for each new value it did the operations in the indented block (here just one line that called the print function).\n\n\nfor Loops\nThe general structure of a standard for loop is as follows.\n\nfor item in iterable:\n   # operation 1 with item\n   # operation 2 with item\n   # ...\n   # operation N with item\n\nwhere iterable is anything capable of producing one item at a time (see here for official definition from the Python team).\nWe’ve actually already seen some of the most common iterables!\nLists, tuples, dicts, and range/zip/enumerate objects are all iterables.\nNote that we can have as many operations as we want inside the indented block.\nWe will refer to the indented block as the “body” of the loop.\nWhen the for loop is executed, item will take on one value from iterable at a time and execute the loop body for each value.\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list.\nWhen iterating, each item in iterable might actually contain more than one value.\nRecall that tuples (and lists) can be unpacked directly into variables.\n\ntup = (4, \"test\")\ni, x = tup\nprint(f\"i = {i}, x = {x}, tup = {tup}\")\n\nAlso, recall that the value of a enumerate(iterable) is a tuple of the form (i, x) where iterable[i] == x.\nWhen we use enumerate in a for loop, we can “unpack” both values at the same time as follows:\n\n# revenue by quarter\ncompany_revenue = [5.12, 5.20, 5.50, 6.50]\n\nfor index, value in enumerate(company_revenue):\n    print(f\"quarter {index} revenue is ${value} million\")\n\nSimilarly, the index can be used to access another vector.\n\ncities = [\"Phoenix\", \"Austin\", \"San Diego\", \"New York\"]\nstates = [\"Arizona\", \"Texas\", \"California\", \"New York\"]\nfor index, city in enumerate(cities):\n    state = states[index]\n    print(f\"{city} is in {state}\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 6 in the exercise list.\n\n\nwhile Loops\nA related but slightly different form of iteration is to repeat something until some condition is met.\nThis is typically achieved using a while loop.\nThe structure of a while loop is\n\nwhile True_condition:\n    # repeat these steps\n\nwhere True_condition is some conditional statement that should evaluate to True when iterations should continue and False when Python should stop iterating.\nFor example, suppose we wanted to know the smallest N such that $ _{i=0}^N i &gt; 1000 $.\nWe figure this out using a while loop as follows.\n\ntotal = 0\ni = 0\nwhile total &lt;= 1000:\n    i = i + 1\n    total = total + i\n\nprint(\"The answer is\", i)\n\nLet’s check our work.\n\n# Should be just less than 1000 because range(45) goes from 0 to 44\nsum(range(45))\n\n\n# should be between 990 + 45 = 1035\nsum(range(46))\n\nA warning: one common programming error with while loops is to forget to set the variable you use in the condition prior to executing. For example, take the following code which correctly sets a counter\n\ni = 0\n\nAnd then executes a while loop\n\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(i)\n    i = i + 1\nprint(\"done\")\n\nNo problems. But if you were to execute the above cell again, or another cell, the i=3 remains, and code is never executed (since i &lt; 3 begins as False).\n\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(i)\n    i = i + 1\nprint(\"done\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 7 in the exercise list.\n\n\nbreak and continue\n\nbreak Out of a Loop\nSometimes we want to stop a loop early if some condition is met.\nLet’s revisit the example of finding the smallest N such that $ _{i=0}^N i &gt; 1000 $.\nClearly N must be less than 1000, so we know we will find the answer if we start with a for loop over all items in range(1001).\nThen, we can keep a running total as we proceed and tell Python to stop iterating through our range once total goes above 1000.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1001):\n    total = total + i\n    if total &gt; 1000:\n        break\n\nprint(\"The answer is\", i)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 8 in the exercise list.\n\n\ncontinue to the Next Iteration\nSometimes we might want to stop the body of a loop early if a condition is met.\nTo do this we can use the continue keyword.\nThe basic syntax for doing this is:\n\nfor item in iterable:\n    # always do these operations\n    if condition:\n        continue\n\n    # only do these operations if condition is False\n\nInside the loop body, Python will stop that loop iteration of the loop and continue directly to the next iteration when it encounters the continue statement.\nFor example, suppose I ask you to loop over the numbers 1 to 10 and print out the message “{i} An odd number!” whenever the number i is odd, and do nothing otherwise.\nYou can use continue to do this as follows:\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:  # an even number... This is modulus division\n        continue\n\n    print(i, \"is an odd number!\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 9 in the exercise list.",

How many months would an employee need to stay for the company to find it profitable to pay for their employees to learn Python if their discount rate is r = 0.01?\n\n# Define cost of teaching python\ncost = 25_000\nr = 0.01\n\n# Per month value\nadded_value = 2500\n\nn_months = 0\ntotal_npv = 0.0\n\n# Put condition below here\nwhile False: # (replace False with your condition here)\n    n_months = n_months + 1  # Increment how many months they've worked\n\n    # Increase total_npv\n\n(back to text)\n\n\nExercise 8\nTry to find the index of the first value in x that is greater than 0.999 using a for loop and break.\ntry iterating over range(len(x)).\n\nx = np.random.rand(10_000)\n# Your code here\n\n(back to text)\n\n\nExercise 9\nWrite a for loop that adds up all values in x that are greater than or equal to 0.5.\nUse the continue word to end the body of the loop early for all values of x that are less than 0.5.\nTry starting your loop with for value in x: instead of iterating over the indices of x.\n\nx = np.random.rand(10_000)\n# Your code here\n\n(back to text)\n\n\nExercise 10\nReturning to our previous example: print “{city} is in {state}” for each combination using a zip and a comprehension.\nTry using zip\n\ncities = [\"Phoenix\", \"Austin\", \"San Diego\", \"New York\"]\nstates = [\"Arizona\", \"Texas\", \"California\", \"New York\"]\n\n# your code here\n\n(back to text)",

Syntax is remminiscent of a for loop.\n\n[i**2 for i in range(10)]\n\n\nset(i-(i//2*2) for i in range(10))\n\n\n{i: i**2 for i in range(10)}\n\nComprehension can be combined with conditions:\n\n[i**2 for i in range(10) if i//3&gt;2]\n\nBehind the comprehension syntax, there is a special object called generator. Its role is to supply objects one by one like any other iterable.\n\n# note the bracket\ngen = (i**2 for i in range(10))\ngen # does nothing\n\n\ngen = (i**2 for i in range(10))\nfor e in gen:\n    print(e)\n\n\ngen = (i**2 for i in range(10))\nprint([e for e in gen])\n\nThere is a shortcut to converte a generator into a list: it’s called unpacking:\n\ngen = (i**2 for i in range(10))\n[*gen]",

This is to avoid name conflicts as in:\n\ny = 1\ndef f(x):\n    y = x**2\n    return y+1\ndef g(x):\n    y = x**2+0.1\n    return y+1\nr1 = f(1.4)\nr2 = g(1.4)\nr3 = y\n(r1,r2,r3)\n\n\nl = ['france', 'germany']\ndef fun(i):\n    print(f\"Country: {l[i]}\")\nfun(0)\n\n\nl = ['france', 'germany']\ndef fun(i):\n    l = ['usa', 'japan']\n    l.append('spain')\n    print(f\"Country: {l[i]}\")\nfun(0)\n\n\nl\n\nIn the preceding code block, value of y has not been changed by calling the two functions. Check pythontutor.\n\nCalling conventions\nFunction definitions start with def and a colon indentation. Value are returned by return keyword. Otherwise the return value is None. Functions can have several arguments: def f(x,y) but always one return argument. It is however to return a tuple, and “unpack” it.\n\ndef f(x,y):\n    z1 = x+y\n    z2 = x-y\n    return (z1,z2)      # here brackets are optional:  `return z1,z2` works too\n\nres = f(0.1, 0.2)\nt1, t2 = f(0.2, 0.2)     # t1,t2=res works too\n\n\nres\n\nNamed arguments can be passed in any order and receive default values.\n\ndef problem(why=\"The moon shines.\", what=\"Curiosity killed the cat.\", where=\"Paris\"):\n    print(f\"Is it because {why.lower().strip('.')} that {what.lower().strip('.')}, in {where.strip('.')}?\")\n\n\nproblem(where='Paris')\n\n\nproblem(where=\"ESCP\", why=\"Square root of two is irrational\", what=\"Some regressions never work.\")\n\nPositional arguments and keyword arguments can be combined\n\ndef f(x, y, β=0.9, γ=4.0, δ=0.1):\n    return x*β+y**γ*δ\n\n\nf(0.1, 0.2)\n\n\n\nDocstrings\nFunctions are documented with a special string. Documentation It must follow the function signature immediately and explain what arguments are expected and what the function does\n\ndef f(x, y, β=0.9, γ=4.0, δ=0.1):   # kjhkugku\n    \"\"\"Compute the model residuals\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x: (float) marginal propensity to do complicated stuff\n    y: (float) inverse of the elasticity of bifractional risk-neutral substitution\n    β: (float) time discount (default 0.9)\n    γ: (float) time discount (default 4.0)\n    δ: (float) time discount (default 0.1)\n    \n    Result\n    ------\n    res: beta-Hadamard measure of cohesiveness\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    res = x*β+y**γ*δ\n    return res\n\nRemark: Python 3.6 has introduced type indication for functions. They are useful as an element of indication and potentially for type checking. We do not cover them in this tutorial but this is what they look like:\n\ndef f(a: int, b:int)-&gt;int:\n    if a&lt;=1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return f(a-1,b) + f(a-2,b)*b\n\n\n\n\nPacking and unpacking\nA common case is when one wants to pass the elements of an iterable as positional argument and/or the elements of a dictionary as keyword arguments. This is espacially the case, when one wants to determine functions that act on a given calibration. Without unpacking all arguments would need to be passed separately.\n\nv = (0.1, 0.2)\np = dict(β=0.9, γ=4.0, δ=0.1)\n\nf(v[0], v[1], β=p['β'], γ=p['γ'], δ=p['δ'])\n\nThere is a special syntax for that: * unpacks positional arguments and ** unpacks keyword arguments. Here is an example:\n\nf(*v, **p)\n\nThe same characters * and ** can actually be used for the reverse operation, that is packing. This is useful to determine functions of a variable number of arguments.\n\ndef fun(**p):\n    β = p['β']\n    return β+1\nfun(β=1.0)\nfun(β=1.0, γ=2.0) # γ is just ignored\n\nInside the function, unpacked objects are lists and dictionaries respectively.\n\ndef fun(*args, **kwargs):\n    print(f\"Positional arguments: {len(args)}\")\n    for a in args:\n        print(f\"- {a}\")\n    print(f\"Keyword arguments: {len(args)}\")\n    for key,value in kwargs.items():\n        print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n\n\nfun(0.1, 0.2, a=2, b=3, c=4)\n\n\n\nFunctions are first class objects\nThis means they can be assigned and passed around.\n\ndef f(x): return 2*x*(1-x)\ng = f # now `g` and `f` point to the same function\ng(0.4)\n\n\ndef sumsfun(l, f):\n    return [f(e) for e in l]\n\n\nsumsfun([0.0, 0.1, 0.2], f)\n\n\ndef compute_recursive_series(x0, fun, T=50):\n    a = [x0]\n    for t in range(T):\n        x0 = a[-1]\n        x = fun(x0)\n        a.append(x)\n    return a\n\ncompute_recursive_series(0.3, f, T=5)\n\nThere is another syntax to define a function, without giving it a name first: lambda functions. It is useful when passing a function as argument.\n\nsorted(range(6), key=lambda x: (-2)**x)\n\nLambda functions are also useful to reduce quickly the number of arguments of a function (aka curryfication)\n\ndef logistic(μ,x): return μ*x*(1-x)\n# def chaotic(x): return logistic(3.7, x)\n# def convergent(x): return logistic(2.5, x)\nchaotic = lambda x: logistic(3.7, x)\nconvergent = lambda x: logistic(2.5, x)\n\n\nl = [compute_recursive_series(0.3,fun, T=20) for fun in [convergent, chaotic]]\n[*zip(*l)]\n\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\ntab = np.array(l)\nplt.plot(tab[0,:-1],tab[0,1:])\ntab = np.array(l)\nplt.plot(tab[1,:-1],tab[1,1:])\nplt.plot(np.linspace(0,1),np.linspace(0,1))\nplt.xlabel(\"$x_n$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"$x_{n+1}$\")\nplt.grid()\n\n\n\nFunctions pass arguments by reference\nMost of the time, variable affectation just create a reference.\n\na = [1,2,3]\nb = a\na[1] = 0\n(a, b)\n\nTo get a copy instead, one needs to specify it explicitly.\n\nimport copy\na = [1,2,3]\nb = copy.copy(a)\na[1] = 0\n(a, b)\n\nNot that copy follows only one level of references. Use deepcopy for more safety.\n\na0 = ['a','b']\na = [a0, 1, 2]\nb = copy.copy(a)\na[0][0] = 'ξ'\na, b\n\n\na0 = ['a','b']\na = [a0, 1, 2]\nb = copy.deepcopy(a)\na[0][0] = 'ξ'\na, b\n\nArguments in a function are references towards the original object. No data is copied. It is then easy to construct functions with side-effects.\n\ndef append_inplace(l1, obs):\n    l1.append(obs)\n    return l1\nl1, obs = ([1,2,3], 1.5)\nl2 = append_inplace(l1,obs)\nprint(l2, l1)\n# note that l1 and l2 point to the same object\nl1[0] = 'hey'\nprint(l2, l1)\n\nThis behaviour might feel unnatural but is very sensible. For instance if the argument is a database of several gigabytes and one wants to write a function which will modify a few of its elements, it is not reasonable to copy the db in full.",

    "section": "Objects",
    "text": "Objects\nObjects ?\n\ncan be passed around / referred too\nhave properties (data) and methods (functions) attached to them\ninherit properties/methods from other objects\n\nObjects are defined by a class definition. By convention, classes names start with uppercase . To create an object, one calls the class name, possibly with additional arguments.\n\nclass Dog:\n    name = \"May\" # class property\n\nd1 = Dog()\nd2 = Dog()\n\nprint(f\"Class: d1-&gt;{type(d1)}, d2-&gt;{type(d2)}\")\nprint(f\"Instance address: d2-&gt;{d1},{d2}\")\n\nNow, d1 and d2 are two different instances of the same class Dog. Since properties are mutable, instances can have different data attached to it.\n\nd1.name = \"Boris\"\nprint([e.name for e in [d1,d2]])\n\nMethods are functions attached to a class / an instance. Their first argument is always an instance. The first argument can be used to acess data held by the instance.\n\nclass Dog:\n    name = None # default value\n    def bark(self):\n        print(\"Wouf\")\n    def converse(self):\n        n = self.name\n        print(f\"Hi, my name is {n}. I'm committed to a strong and stable government.\")\n        \nd = Dog()\nd.bark()   # bark(d)\nd.converse()\n\n\nConstructor\nThere is also a special method __init__ called the constructor. When an object is created, it is called on the instance. This is useful in order to initialize parameters of the instance.\n\nclass Calibration:\n    \n    def __init__(self, x=0.1, y=0.1, β=0.0):\n        if not (β&gt;0) and (β&lt;1):\n            raise Exception(\"Incorrect calibration\"})\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.β = β\n\n\nc1 = Calibration()\nc2 = Calibration(x=3, y=4)\n\nTwo instances of the same class have the same method, but can hold different data. This can change the behaviour of these methods.\n\n# class Dog:\n    \n#     state = 'ok'\n    \n#     def bark(self):\n#         if self.state == 'ok':\n#             print(\"Wouf!\")\n#         else:\n#             print(\"Ahouuu!\")\n        \n# d = Dog()\n# d1 = Dog()\n# d1.state = 'hungry'\n\n# d.bark()\n# d1.bark()\n\nTo write a function which will manipulate properties and methods of an object, it is not required to know its type in advance. The function will succeed as long as the required method exist, fail other wise. This is called “Duck Typing”: if it walks like a duck, it must be a duck…\n\nclass Duck:\n    def walk(self): print(\"/-\\_/-\\_/\")\n        \nclass Dog:\n    def walk(self): print(\"/-\\_/*\\_/\")\n    def bark(self): print(\"Wouf\")\n\n\nanimals = [C() for C in (Duck,Dog)]\ndef go_in_the_park(animal):\n    for i in range(3): animal.walk()\nfor a in animals:\n    go_in_the_park(a)\n\n\nInheritance\nThe whole point of classes, is that one can construct hierarchies of classes to avoid redefining the same methods many times. This is done by using inheritance.\n\nclass Animal:\n    \n    def run(self): print(\"👣\"*4)\n\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def bark(self): print(\"Wouf\")\n        \nclass Rabbit(Animal):\n    def run(self):\n        super().run() ; print( \"🐇\" )\n\n\nAnimal().run()\ndog = Dog()\ndog.run()\ndog.bark()\nRabbit().run()\n\nIn the above example, the Dog class inherits from inherits the method run from the Animal class: it doesn’t need to be redefined again. Essentially, when run(dog) is called, since the method is not defined for a dog, python looks for the first ancestor of dog and applies the method of the ancestor.\n\n\nSpecial methods\nBy conventions methods starting with double lowercase __ are hidden. They don’t appear in tab completion. Several special methods can be reimplemented that way.\n\nclass Calibration:\n    \n    def __init__(self, x=0.1, y=0.1, β=0.1):\n        if not (β&gt;0) and (β&lt;1):\n            raise Exception(\"Incorrect calibration\")\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.β = β\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"Calibration(x={self.x},y={self.y}, β={self.β})\"\n\n\nstr(Calibration() )\n\n\n\ncomplement\nPython is not 100% object oriented. - some objects cannot be subclassed - basic types behave sometimes funny (interning strings)\nmindfuck: Something that destabilizes, confuses, or manipulates a person’s mind.\n\na = 'a'*4192\nb = 'a'*4192\na is b\n\n\na = 'a'*512\nb = 'a'*512\na is b",

They believe we have morphed into 1+1/2 to 2+1/2 percent, and no one thought that we were really going to do anything over time to bring it down to 1 to 2.\n\nSep 2006 St. Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole\n\n\n\nLike most of you, I am not at all alarmist about inflation. I think the worst that is likely to happen would be 20 or 30 basis points over the next year. But even that amount is a little disconcerting for me. I think it is very important for us to maintain our credibility on inflation and it would be somewhat expensive to bring that additional inflation back down.\n\nMarch 2006 Chairman Ben Bernanke\n\n\n\nWith inflation remaining at such rates, we could begin to lose credibility if markets mistakenly inferred that our comfort zone had drifted higher. When we stop raising rates, we ought to be reasonably confident that policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back toward the center of our comfort zone, which I believe is 1+1/2 percent…So for today, we should move forward with an increase of 25 basis points…\n\nJan 2006 Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow",

Python ignores everything in a line that follows a #.\nLet’s practice making some comments.\n\ni = 1  # Assign the value 1 to variable i\nj = 2  # Assign the value 2 to variable j\n\n# We add i and j below this line\ni + j",

    "section": "Ordered Collections",
    "text": "Ordered Collections\n\nLists\nA Python list is an ordered collection of items.\nWe can create lists using the following syntax\n\n[item1, item2, ...,  itemN]\n\nwhere the ... represents any number of additional items.\nEach item can be of any type.\nLet’s create some lists.\n\n# created, but not assigned to a variable\n[2.0, 9.1, 12.5]\n\n\n# stored as the variable `x`\nx = [2.0, 9.1, 12.5]\nprint(\"x has type\", type(x))\nx\n\n\nWhat Can We Do with Lists?\nWe can access items in a list called mylist using mylist[N] where N is an integer.\nNote: Anytime that we use the syntax x[i] we are doing what is called indexing – it means that we are selecting a particular element of a collection x.\n\nx[1]\n\nWait? Why did x[1] return 9.1 when the first element in x is actually 2.0?\nThis happened because Python starts counting at zero!\nLets repeat that one more time for emphasis Python starts counting at zero!\nTo access the first element of x we must use x[0]:\n\nx[0]\n\nWe can also determine how many items are in a list using the len function.\n\nlen(x)\n\nWhat happens if we try to index with a number higher than the number of items in a list?\n\n# uncomment the line below and run\n# x[4]\n\nWe can check if a list contains an element using the in keyword.\n\n2.0 in x\n\n\n1.5 in x\n\nFor our list x, other common operations we might want to do are…\n\nx.reverse()\nx\n\n\nnumber_list = [10, 25, 42, 1.0]\nprint(number_list)\nnumber_list.sort()\nprint(number_list)\n\nNote that in order to sort, we had to have all elements in our list be numbers (int and float), more on this below.\nWe could actually do the same with a list of strings. In this case, sort will put the items in alphabetical order.\n\nstr_list = [\"NY\", \"AZ\", \"TX\"]\nprint(str_list)\nstr_list.sort()\nprint(str_list)\n\nThe append method adds an element to the end of existing list.\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.append(10)\nprint(num_list)\n\nHowever, if you call append with a list, it adds a list to the end, rather than the numbers in that list.\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.append([20, 4])\nprint(num_list)\n\nTo combine the lists instead…\n\nnum_list = [10, 25, 42, 8]\nprint(num_list)\nnum_list.extend([20, 4])\nprint(num_list)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 1 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\n\nLists of Different Types\nWhile most examples above have all used a list with a single type of variable, this is not required.\nLet’s carefully make a small change to the first example: replace 2.0 with 2\n\nx = [2, 9.1, 12.5]\n\nThis behavior is identical for many operations you might apply to a list.\n\nimport numpy as np\nx = [2, 9.1, 12.5]\nnp.mean(x) == sum(x)/len(x)\n\nHere we have also introduced a new module, Numpy, which provides many functions for working with numeric data.\nTaking this further, we can put completely different types of elements inside of a list.\n\n# stored as the variable `x`\nx = [2, \"hello\", 3.0]\nprint(\"x has type\", type(x))\nx\n\nTo see the types of individual elements in the list:\n\nprint(f\"type(x[0]) = {type(x[0])}, type(x[1]) = {type(x[1])}, type(x[2]) = {type(x[2])}\")\n\nWhile no programming limitations prevent this, you should be careful if you write code with different numeric and non-numeric types in the same list.\nFor example, if the types within the list cannot be compared, then how could you sort the elements of the list? (i.e. How do you determine whether the string “hello” is less than the integer 2, “hello” &lt; 2?)\n\nx = [2, \"hello\", 3.0]\n# uncomment the line below and see what happens!\n# x.sort()\n\nA few key exceptions to this general rule are:\n\nLists with both integers and floating points are less error-prone (since mathematical code using the list would work with both types).\n\nWhen working with lists and data, you may want to represent missing values with a different type than the existing values.\n\n\n\nThe range Function\nOne function you will see often in Python is the range function.\nIt has three versions:\n\nrange(N): goes from 0 to N-1\n\nrange(a, N): goes from a to N-1\n\nrange(a, N, d): goes from a to N-1, counting by d\n\nWhen we call the range function, we get back something that has type range:\n\nr = range(5)\nprint(\"type(r)\", type(r))\n\nTo turn the range into a list:\n\nlist(r)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 2 in the exercise list.\n\n\nWhat are Tuples?\nTuples are very similar to lists and hold ordered collections of items.\nHowever, tuples and lists have three main differences:\n\nTuples are created using parenthesis — ( and ) — instead of square brackets — [ and ].\n\nTuples are immutable, which is a fancy computer science word meaning that they can’t be changed or altered after they are created.\n\nTuples and multiple return values from functions are tightly connected, as we will see in functions.\n\n\nt = (1, \"hello\", 3.0)\nprint(\"t is a\", type(t))\nt\n\nWe can convert a list to a tuple by calling the tuple function on a list.\n\nprint(\"x is a\", type(x))\nprint(\"tuple(x) is a\", type(tuple(x)))\ntuple(x)\n\nWe can also convert a tuple to a list using the list function.\n\nlist(t)\n\nAs with a list, we access items in a tuple t using t[N] where N is an int.\n\nt[0]  # still start counting at 0\n\n\nt[2]\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 3 in the exercise list.\nTuples (and lists) can be unpacked directly into variables.\n\nx, y = (1, \"test\")\nprint(f\"x = {x}, y = {y}\")\n\nThis will be a convenient way to work with functions returning multiple values, as well as within comprehensions and loops.\n\n\nList vs Tuple: Which to Use?\nShould you use a list or tuple?\nThis depends on what you are storing, whether you might need to reorder the elements, or whether you’d add new elements without a complete reinterpretation of the underlying data.\nFor example, take data representing the GDP (in trillions) and population (in billions) for China in 2015.\n\nchina_data_2015 = (\"China\", 2015, 11.06, 1.371)\n\nprint(china_data_2015)\n\nIn this case, we have used a tuple since: (a) ordering would be meaningless; and (b) adding more data would require a reinterpretation of the whole data structure.\nOn the other hand, consider a list of GDP in China between 2013 and 2015.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nprint(gdp_data)\n\nIn this case, we have used a list, since adding on a new element to the end of the list for GDP in 2016 would make complete sense.\nAlong these lines, collecting data on China for different years may make sense as a list of tuples (e.g. year, GDP, and population – although we will see better ways to store this sort of data in the Pandas section).\n\nchina_data = [(2015, 11.06, 1.371), (2014, 10.48, 1.364), (2013, 9.607, 1.357)]\nprint(china_data)\n\nIn general, a rule of thumb is to use a list unless you need to use a tuple.\nKey criteria for tuple use are when you want to:\n\nensure the order of elements can’t change\n\nensure the actual values of the elements can’t change\n\nuse the collection as a key in a dict (we will learn what this means soon)\n\n\n\nzip and enumerate\nTwo functions that can be extremely useful are zip and enumerate.\nBoth of these functions are best understood by example, so let’s see them in action and then talk about what they do.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nyears = [2013, 2014, 2015]\nz = zip(years, gdp_data)\nprint(\"type(z)\", type(z))\n\nTo see what is inside z, let’s convert it to a list.\n\nlist(z)\n\nNotice that we now have a list where each item is a tuple.\nWithin each tuple, we have one item from each of the collections we passed to the zip function.\nIn particular, the first item in z contains the first item from [2013, 2014, 2015] and the first item from [9.607, 10.48, 11.06].\nThe second item in z contains the second item from each collection and so on.\nWe can access an element in this and then unpack the resulting tuple directly into variables.\n\nl = list(zip(years, gdp_data))\nx, y = l[0]\nprint(f\"year = {x}, GDP = {y}\")\n\nNow let’s experiment with enumerate.\n\ne = enumerate([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\nprint(\"type(e)\", type(e))\ne\n\nAgain, we call list(e) to see what is inside.\n\nlist(e)\n\nWe again have a list of tuples, but this time, the first element in each tuple is the index of the second tuple element in the initial collection.\nNotice that the third item is (2, 'c') because [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"][2] is 'c'\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 4 in the exercise list.\nAn important quirk of some iterable types that are not lists (such as the above zip) is that you cannot convert the same type to a list twice.\nThis is because zip, enumerate, and range produce what is called a generator.\nA generator will only produce each of its elements a single time, so if you call list on the same generator a second time, it will not have any elements to iterate over anymore.\nFor more information, refer to the Python documentation.\n\ngdp_data = [9.607, 10.48, 11.06]\nyears = [2013, 2014, 2015]\nz = zip(years, gdp_data)\nl = list(z)\nprint(l)\nm = list(z)\nprint(m)",

    "text": "Associative Collections\n\n\nDictionaries\nA dictionary (or dict) associates keys with values.\nIt will feel similar to a dictionary for words, where the keys are words and the values are the associated definitions.\nThe most common way to create a dict is to use curly braces — { and } — like this:\n\n{\"key1\": value1, \"key2\": value2, ..., \"keyN\": valueN}\n\nwhere the ... indicates that we can have any number of additional terms.\nThe crucial part of the syntax is that each key-value pair is written key: value and that these pairs are separated by commas — ,.\nLet’s see an example using our aggregate data on China in 2015.\n\nchina_data = {\"country\": \"China\", \"year\": 2015, \"GDP\" : 11.06, \"population\": 1.371}\nprint(china_data)\n\nUnlike our above example using a tuple, a dict allows us to associate a name with each field, rather than having to remember the order within the tuple.\nOften, code that makes a dict is easier to read if we put each key: value pair on its own line. (Recall our earlier comment on using whitespace effectively to improve readability!)\nThe code below is equivalent to what we saw above.\n\nchina_data = {\n    \"country\": \"China\",\n    \"year\": 2015,\n    \"GDP\" : 11.06,\n    \"population\": 1.371\n}\n\nMost often, the keys (e.g. “country”, “year”, “GDP”, and “population”) will be strings, but we could also use numbers (int, or float) or even tuples (or, rarely, a combination of types).\nThe values can be any type and different from each other.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list.\nThis next example is meant to emphasize how values can be anything – including another dictionary.\n\ncompanies = {\"AAPL\": {\"bid\": 175.96, \"ask\": 175.98},\n             \"GE\": {\"bid\": 1047.03, \"ask\": 1048.40},\n             \"TVIX\": {\"bid\": 8.38, \"ask\": 8.40}}\nprint(companies)\n\n\nGetting, Setting, and Updating dict Items\nWe can now ask Python to tell us the value for a particular key by using the syntax d[k], where d is our dict and k is the key for which we want to find the value.\nFor example,\n\nprint(china_data[\"year\"])\nprint(f\"country = {china_data['country']}, population = {china_data['population']}\")\n\nNote: when inside of a formatting string, you can use ' instead of \" as above to ensure the formatting still works with the embedded code.\nIf we ask for the value of a key that is not in the dict, we will get an error.\n\n# uncomment the line below to see the error\n# china_data[\"inflation\"]\n\nWe can also add new items to a dict using the syntax d[new_key] = new_value.\nLet’s see some examples.\n\nprint(china_data)\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = \"4.05%\"\nprint(china_data)\n\nTo update the value, we use assignment in the same way (which will create the key and value as required).\n\nprint(china_data)\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = \"4.051%\"\nprint(china_data)\n\nOr we could change the type.\n\nchina_data[\"unemployment\"] = 4.051\nprint(china_data)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 6 in the exercise list.\n\n\nCommon dict Functionality\nWe can do some common things with dicts.\nWe will demonstrate them with examples below.\n\n# number of key-value pairs in a dict\nlen(china_data)\n\n\n# get a list of all the keys\nlist(china_data.keys())\n\n\n# get a list of all the values\nlist(china_data.values())\n\n\nmore_china_data = {\"irrigated_land\": 690_070, \"top_religions\": {\"buddhist\": 18.2, \"christian\" : 5.1, \"muslim\": 1.8}}\n\n# Add all key-value pairs in mydict2 to mydict.\n# if the key already appears in mydict, overwrite the\n# value with the value in mydict2\nchina_data.update(more_china_data)\nchina_data\n\n\n# Get the value associated with a key or return a default value\n# use this to avoid the NameError we saw above if you have a reasonable\n# default value\nchina_data.get(\"irrigated_land\", \"Data Not Available\")\n\n\nchina_data.get(\"death_rate\", \"Data Not Available\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 7 in the exercise list.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 8 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\nSets (Optional)\nPython has an additional way to represent collections of items: sets.\nSets come up infrequently, but you should be aware of them.\nIf you are familiar with the mathematical concept of sets, then you will understand the majority of Python sets already.\nIf you don’t know the math behind sets, don’t worry: we’ll cover the basics of Python’s sets here.\nA set is an unordered collection of unique elements.\nThe syntax for creating a set uses curly bracket { and }.\n\n{item1, item2, ..., itemN}\n\nHere is an example.\n\ns = {1, \"hello\", 3.0}\nprint(\"s has type\", type(s))\ns\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 9 in the exercise list.\nAs with lists and tuples, we can check if something is in the set and check the set’s length:\n\nprint(\"len(s) =\", len(s))\n\"hello\" in s\n\nUnlike lists and tuples, we can’t extract elements of a set s using s[N] where N is a number.\n\n# Uncomment the line below to see what happens\n# s[1]\n\nThis is because sets are not ordered, so the notion of getting the second element (s[1]) is not well defined.\nWe add elements to a set s using s.add.\n\ns.add(100)\ns\n\n\ns.add(\"hello\") # nothing happens, why?\ns\n\nWe can also do set operations.\nConsider the set s from above and the set s2 = {\"hello\", \"world\"}.\n\ns.union(s2): returns a set with all elements in either s or s2\n\ns.intersection(s2): returns a set with all elements in both s and s2\n\ns.difference(s2): returns a set with all elements in s that aren’t in s2\n\ns.symmetric_difference(s2): returns a set with all elements in only one of s and s2\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 10 in the exercise list.\nAs with tuples and lists, a set function can convert other collections to sets.\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 1]\nset(x)\n\n\nt = (1, 2, 3, 1)\nset(t)\n\nLikewise, we can convert sets to lists and tuples.\n\nlist(s)\n\n\ntuple(s)",

    "text": "Net Present Values and Asset Pricing\nIn this lecture, we’ll introduce two related topics from economics:\n\nNet present valuations\n\nAsset pricing\n\nThese topics will motivate some of the programming we do in this course.\nIn economics and finance, “assets” provide a stream of payoffs.\nThese “assets” can be concrete or abstract: a stock pays dividends over time, a bond pays interest, an apple tree provides apples, a job pays wages, and an education provides possible jobs (which, in turn, pay wages).\nWhen deciding the price to pay for an asset or how to choose between different alternatives, we need to take into account that most people would prefer to receive 1 today vs. 1 next year.\nThis reflection on consumer preferences leads to the notion of a discount rate. If you are indifferent between receiving 1.00 today and 1.10 next year, then the discount rate over the next year is $ r = 0.10 $.\nIf we assume that an individuals preferences are consistent over time, then we can apply that same discount rate to valuing assets further into the future.\nFor example, we would expect that the consumer would be indifferent between consuming 1.00 today and $ (1+r)(1+r) = 1.21 $ dollars two years from now (i.e. discount twice).\nInverting this formula, 1 delivered two years from now is equivalent to $ $ today."

    "text": "Iteration\nWhen doing computations or analyzing data, we often need to repeat certain operations a finite number of times or until some condition is met.\nExamples include processing all data files in a directory (folder), aggregating revenues and costs for every period in a year, or computing the net present value of certain assets. (In fact, later in this section, we will verify the equations that we wrote down above.)\nThese are all examples of a programming concept called iteration.\nWe feel the concept is best understood through example, so we will present a contrived example and then discuss the details behind doing iteration in Python.\n\nA Contrived Example\nSuppose we wanted to print out the first 10 integers and their squares.\nWe could do something like this.\n\nprint(f\"1**2 = {1**2}\")\nprint(f\"2**2 = {2**2}\")\nprint(f\"3**2 = {3**2}\")\nprint(f\"4**2 = {4**2}\")\n# .. and so on until 10\n\nAs you can see, the code above is repetitive.\nFor each integer, the code is exactly the same except for the two places where the “current” integer appears.\nSuppose that I asked you to write the same print statement for an int stored in a variable named i.\nYou might write the following code:\n\nprint(f\"{i}**2 = {i**2}\")\n\nThis more general version of the operation suggests a strategy for achieving our goal with less repetition: have a variable i take on the values 1 through 10 (Quiz: How can we use range to create the numbers 1 to 10?) and run the line of code above for each new value of i.\nThis can be accomplished with a for loop!\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n     print(f\"{i}**2 = {i**2}\")\n\nWhoa, what just happened?\nThe integer i took on the values in range(1, 11) one by one and for each new value it did the operations in the indented block (here just one line that called the print function).\n\n\nfor Loops\nThe general structure of a standard for loop is as follows.\n\nfor item in iterable:\n   # operation 1 with item\n   # operation 2 with item\n   # ...\n   # operation N with item\n\nwhere iterable is anything capable of producing one item at a time (see here for official definition from the Python team).\nWe’ve actually already seen some of the most common iterables!\nLists, tuples, dicts, and range/zip/enumerate objects are all iterables.\nNote that we can have as many operations as we want inside the indented block.\nWe will refer to the indented block as the “body” of the loop.\nWhen the for loop is executed, item will take on one value from iterable at a time and execute the loop body for each value.\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list.\nWhen iterating, each item in iterable might actually contain more than one value.\nRecall that tuples (and lists) can be unpacked directly into variables.\n\ntup = (4, \"test\")\ni, x = tup\nprint(f\"i = {i}, x = {x}, tup = {tup}\")\n\nAlso, recall that the value of a enumerate(iterable) is a tuple of the form (i, x) where iterable[i] == x.\nWhen we use enumerate in a for loop, we can “unpack” both values at the same time as follows:\n\n# revenue by quarter\ncompany_revenue = [5.12, 5.20, 5.50, 6.50]\n\nfor index, value in enumerate(company_revenue):\n    print(f\"quarter {index} revenue is ${value} million\")\n\nSimilarly, the index can be used to access another vector.\n\ncities = [\"Phoenix\", \"Austin\", \"San Diego\", \"New York\"]\nstates = [\"Arizona\", \"Texas\", \"California\", \"New York\"]\nfor index, city in enumerate(cities):\n    state = states[index]\n    print(f\"{city} is in {state}\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 6 in the exercise list.\n\n\nwhile Loops\nA related but slightly different form of iteration is to repeat something until some condition is met.\nThis is typically achieved using a while loop.\nThe structure of a while loop is\n\nwhile True_condition:\n    # repeat these steps\n\nwhere True_condition is some conditional statement that should evaluate to True when iterations should continue and False when Python should stop iterating.\nFor example, suppose we wanted to know the smallest N such that $ _{i=0}^N i &gt; 1000 $.\nWe figure this out using a while loop as follows.\n\ntotal = 0\ni = 0\nwhile total &lt;= 1000:\n    i = i + 1\n    total = total + i\n\nprint(\"The answer is\", i)\n\nLet’s check our work.\n\n# Should be just less than 1000 because range(45) goes from 0 to 44\nsum(range(45))\n\n\n# should be between 990 + 45 = 1035\nsum(range(46))\n\nA warning: one common programming error with while loops is to forget to set the variable you use in the condition prior to executing. For example, take the following code which correctly sets a counter\n\ni = 0\n\nAnd then executes a while loop\n\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(i)\n    i = i + 1\nprint(\"done\")\n\nNo problems. But if you were to execute the above cell again, or another cell, the i=3 remains, and code is never executed (since i &lt; 3 begins as False).\n\nwhile i &lt; 3:\n    print(i)\n    i = i + 1\nprint(\"done\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 7 in the exercise list.\n\n\nbreak and continue\n\nbreak Out of a Loop\nSometimes we want to stop a loop early if some condition is met.\nLet’s revisit the example of finding the smallest N such that $ _{i=0}^N i &gt; 1000 $.\nClearly N must be less than 1000, so we know we will find the answer if we start with a for loop over all items in range(1001).\nThen, we can keep a running total as we proceed and tell Python to stop iterating through our range once total goes above 1000.\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1001):\n    total = total + i\n    if total &gt; 1000:\n        break\n\nprint(\"The answer is\", i)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 8 in the exercise list.\n\n\ncontinue to the Next Iteration\nSometimes we might want to stop the body of a loop early if a condition is met.\nTo do this we can use the continue keyword.\nThe basic syntax for doing this is:\n\nfor item in iterable:\n    # always do these operations\n    if condition:\n        continue\n\n    # only do these operations if condition is False\n\nInside the loop body, Python will stop that loop iteration of the loop and continue directly to the next iteration when it encounters the continue statement.\nFor example, suppose I ask you to loop over the numbers 1 to 10 and print out the message “{i} An odd number!” whenever the number i is odd, and do nothing otherwise.\nYou can use continue to do this as follows:\n\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    if i % 2 == 0:  # an even number... This is modulus division\n        continue\n\n    print(i, \"is an odd number!\")\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 9 in the exercise list."

    "text": "How to Define (Python) Functions?\nThe basic syntax to create our own function is as follows:\n\ndef function_name(inputs):\n    # step 1\n    # step 2\n    # ...\n    return outputs\n\nHere we see two new keywords: def and return.\n\ndef is used to tell Python we would like to define a new function.\n\nreturn is used to tell Python what we would like to return from a function.\n\nLet’s look at an example and then discuss each part:\n\ndef mean(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    N = len(numbers)\n    answer = total / N\n\n    return answer\n\nHere we defined a function mean that has one input (numbers), does three steps, and has one output (answer).\nLet’s see what happens when we call this function on the list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nthe_mean = mean(x)\nthe_mean\n\nAdditionally, as we saw in the control flow lecture, indentation controls blocks of code (along with the scope rules).\nTo see this, compare a function with no inputs or return values.\n\ndef f():\n    print(\"1\")\n    print(\"2\")\nf()\n\nWith the following change of indentation…\n\ndef f():\n    print(\"1\")\nprint(\"2\")\nf()\n\n\n\nScope\nNotice that we named the input to the function x and we called the output the_mean.\nWhen we defined the function, the input was called numbers and the output answer… what gives?\nThis is an example of a programming concept called variable scope.\nIn Python, functions define their own scope for variables.\nIn English, this means that regardless of what name we give an input variable (x in this example), the input will always be referred to as numbers inside the body of the mean function.\nIt also means that although we called the output answer inside of the function mean, that this variable name was only valid inside of our function.\nTo use the output of the function, we had to give it our own name (the_mean in this example).\nAnother point to make here is that the intermediate variables we defined inside mean (total and N) are only defined inside of the mean function – we can’t access them from outside. We can verify this by trying to see what the value of total is:\n\ndef mean(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    N = len(numbers)\n    answer = total / N\n    return answer # or directly return total / N\n\n# uncomment the line below and execute to see the error\n# total\n\nThis point can be taken even further: the same name can be bound to variables inside of blocks of code and in the outer “scope”.\n\nx = 4\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\ndef f():\n    x = 5 # a different \"x\"\n    print(f\"x = {x}\")\nf() # calls function\nprint(f\"x = {x}\")\n\nThe final point we want to make about scope is that function inputs and output don’t have to be given a name outside the function.\n\nmean([10, 20, 30])\n\nNotice that we didn’t name the input or the output, but the function was called successfully.\nNow, we’ll use our new knowledge to define a function which computes the output from a Cobb-Douglas production function with parameters $ z = 1 $ and $ = 0.33 $ and takes inputs $ K $ and $ L $.\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L):\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n    alpha = 0.33\n\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\nWe can use this function as we did the mean function.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\n\n\n\nRe-using Functions\nEconomists are often interested in this question: how much does output change if we modify our inputs?\nFor example, take a production function $ Y_1 = F(K_1,L_1) $ which produces $ Y_1 $ units of the goods.\nIf we then multiply the inputs each by $ \\(, so that\\) K_2 = K_1 $ and $ L_2 = L_1 $, then the output is\n\\[\nY_2 = F(K_2, L_2) = F(\\gamma K_1, \\gamma L_1)\n\\]\nHow does $ Y_1 $ compare to $ Y_2 $?\nAnswering this question involves something called returns to scale.\nReturns to scale tells us whether our inputs are more or less productive as we have more of them.\nFor example, imagine that you run a restaurant. How would you expect the amount of food you could produce would change if you could build an exact replica of your restaurant and kitchen and hire the same number of cooks and waiters? You would probably expect it to double.\nIf, for any $ K, L $, we multiply $ K, L $ by a value $ $ then\n\nIf $ &lt; $ then we say the production function has decreasing returns to scale.\n\nIf $ = $ then we say the production function has constant returns to scale.\n\nIf $ &gt; $ then we say the production function has increasing returns to scale.\n\nLet’s try it and see what our function is!\n\ny1 = cobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\nprint(y1)\ny2 = cobb_douglas(2*1.0, 2*0.5)\nprint(y2)\n\nHow did $ Y_1 $ and $ Y_2 $ relate?\n\ny2 / y1\n\n$ Y_2 $ was exactly double $ Y_1 $!\nLet’s write a function that will compute the returns to scale for different values of $ K $ and $ L $.\nThis is an example of how writing functions can allow us to re-use code in ways we might not originally anticipate. (You didn’t know we’d be writing a returns_to_scale function when we wrote cobb_douglas.)\n\ndef returns_to_scale(K, L, gamma):\n    y1 = cobb_douglas(K, L)\n    y2 = cobb_douglas(gamma*K, gamma*L)\n    y_ratio = y2 / y1\n    return y_ratio / gamma\n\n\nreturns_to_scale(1.0, 0.5, 2.0)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 1 in the exercise list.\nIt turns out that with a little bit of algebra, we can check that this will always hold for our Cobb-Douglas example above.\nTo show this, take an arbitrary $ K, L $ and multiply the inputs by an arbitrary $ $.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    F(\\gamma K, \\gamma L) &= z (\\gamma K)^{\\alpha} (\\gamma L)^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    &=  z \\gamma^{\\alpha}\\gamma^{1-\\alpha} K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    &= \\gamma z K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha} = \\gamma F(K, L)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor an example of a production function that is not CRS, look at a generalization of the Cobb-Douglas production function that has different “output elasticities” for the 2 inputs.\n\\[\nY = z K^{\\alpha_1} L^{\\alpha_2}\n\\]\nNote that if $ _2 = 1 - _1 $, this is our Cobb-Douglas production function.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 2 in the exercise list.\n\n\n\nMultiple Returns\nAnother valuable element to analyze on production functions is how output changes as we change only one of the inputs. We will call this the marginal product.\nFor example, compare the output using $ K, L $ units of inputs to that with an $ $ units of labor.\nThen the marginal product of labor (MPL) is defined as\n\\[\n\\frac{F(K, L + \\varepsilon) - F(K, L)}{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\nThis tells us how much additional output is created relative to the additional input. (Spoiler alert: This should look like the definition for a partial derivative!)\nIf the input can be divided into small units, then we can use calculus to take this limit, using the partial derivative of the production function relative to that input.\nIn this case, we define the marginal product of labor (MPL) and marginal product of capital (MPK) as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMPL(K, L) &= \\frac{\\partial F(K, L)}{\\partial L}\\\\\nMPK(K, L) &= \\frac{\\partial F(K, L)}{\\partial K}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the Cobb-Douglas example above, this becomes\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nMPK(K, L) &= z  \\alpha \\left(\\frac{K}{L} \\right)^{\\alpha - 1}\\\\\nMPL(K, L) &= (1-\\alpha) z \\left(\\frac{K}{L} \\right)^{\\alpha}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet’s test it out with Python! We’ll also see that we can actually return multiple things in a Python function.\nThe syntax for a return statement with multiple items is return item1, item2, ….\nIn this case, we’ll compute both the MPL and the MPK and then return both.\n\ndef marginal_products(K, L, epsilon):\n\n    mpl = (cobb_douglas(K, L + epsilon) - cobb_douglas(K, L)) / epsilon\n    mpk = (cobb_douglas(K + epsilon, L) - cobb_douglas(K, L)) / epsilon\n\n    return mpl, mpk\n\n\ntup = marginal_products(1.0, 0.5,  1e-4)\nprint(tup)\n\nInstead of using the tuple, these can be directly unpacked to variables.\n\nmpl, mpk = marginal_products(1.0, 0.5,  1e-4)\nprint(f\"mpl = {mpl}, mpk = {mpk}\")\n\nWe can use this to calculate the marginal products for different K, fixing L using a comprehension.\n\nKs = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n[marginal_products(K, 0.5, 1e-4) for K in Ks] # create a tuple for each K\n\n\n\nDocumentation\nIn a previous exercise, we asked you to find help for the cobb_douglas and returns_to_scale functions using ?.\nIt didn’t provide any useful information.\nTo provide this type of help information, we need to add what Python programmers call a “docstring” to our functions.\nThis is done by putting a string (not assigned to any variable name) as the first line of the body of the function (after the line with def).\nBelow is a new version of the template we used to define functions.\n\ndef function_name(inputs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Docstring\n    \"\"\"\n    # step 1\n    # step 2\n    # ...\n    return outputs\n\nLet’s re-define our cobb_douglas function to include a docstring.\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the production F(K, L) for a Cobb-Douglas production function\n\n    Takes the form F(K, L) = z K^{\\alpha} L^{1 - \\alpha}\n\n    We restrict z = 1 and alpha = 0.33\n    \"\"\"\n    return 1.0 * K**(0.33) * L**(1.0 - 0.33)\n\nNow when we have Jupyter evaluate cobb_douglas?, our message is displayed (or use the Contextual Help window with Jupyterlab and Ctrl-I or Cmd-I).\n\ncobb_douglas?\n\nWe recommend that you always include at least a very simple docstring for nontrivial functions.\nThis is in the same spirit as adding comments to your code — it makes it easier for future readers/users (including yourself) to understand what the code does.\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 3 in the exercise list.\n\n\nDefault and Keyword Arguments\nFunctions can have optional arguments.\nTo accomplish this, we must these arguments a default value by saying name=default_value instead of just name as we list the arguments.\nTo demonstrate this functionality, let’s now make $ z $ and $ $ arguments to our cobb_douglas function!\n\ndef cobb_douglas(K, L, alpha=0.33, z=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the production F(K, L) for a Cobb-Douglas production function\n\n    Takes the form F(K, L) = z K^{\\alpha} L^{1 - \\alpha}\n    \"\"\"\n    return z * K**(alpha) * L**(1.0 - alpha)\n\nWe can now call this function by passing in just K and L. Notice that it will produce same result as earlier because alpha and z are the same as earlier.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\nHowever, we can also set the other arguments of the function by passing more than just K/L.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, 0.35, 1.6)\n\nIn the example above, we used alpha = 0.35, z = 1.6.\nWe can also refer to function arguments by their name, instead of only their position (order).\nTo do this, we would write func_name(arg=value) for as many of the arguments as we want.\nHere’s how to do that with our cobb_douglas example.\n\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, z = 1.5)\n\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 4 in the exercise list.\nIn terms of variable scope, the z name within the function is different from any other z in the outer scope.\nTo be clear,\n\nx = 5\ndef f(x):\n    return x\nf(x) # \"coincidence\" that it has the same name\n\nThis is also true with named function arguments, above.\n\nz = 1.5\ncobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5, z = z) # no problem!\n\nIn that example, the z on the left hand side of z = z refers to the local variable name in the function whereas the z on the right hand side refers to the z in the outer scope.\n\n\nAside: Methods\nAs we learned earlier, all variables in Python have a type associated with them.\nDifferent types of variables have different functions or operations defined for them.\nFor example, I can divide one number by another or make a string uppercase.\nIt wouldn’t make sense to divide one string by another or make a number uppercase.\nWhen certain functionality is closely tied to the type of an object, it is often implemented as a special kind of function known as a method.\nFor now, you only need to know two things about methods:\n\nWe call them by doing variable.method_name(other_arguments) instead of function_name(variable, other_arguments).\n\nA method is a function, even though we call it using a different notation.\n\nWhen we introduced the core data types, we saw many methods defined on these types.\nLet’s revisit them for the str, or string type.\nNotice that we call each of these functions using the dot syntax described above.\n\ns = \"This is my handy string!\"\n\n\ns.upper()\n\n\ns.title()\n\n\n\nCreating Custom Types\nPython allows for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing you to define your own custom types and merge together some sets of parameters with custom methods. This can help you streamline your code by making it more modular.\nWe are used to defining variables like x = dict(\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2) and then using notation like x[\"a\"] to access the value of 1. We can also define our own custom types and use them in similar ways.\nFor example, a simple class that stores two variables would look like this:\n\nclass MyType:\n  def __init__(self, x, y):\n    self.x = x\n    self.y = y\n\nUsed both internal and external to classes, the __init__ method is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object’s state. The self argument refers to the object itself. The self argument is always the first argument of any method in a class. The self argument is not passed in when the method is called, but Python will pass in the object itself when the method is called.\nA class, defined by the class keyword, is a blueprint for an object. It defines the attributes and methods that an object will have. An object is an instance of a class that has been created and assigned to a variable. It is created by calling the class name as if it were a function. When you call the class name, the object is created and the __init__ method is called by default.\n\na = MyType(1, 2)\nb = MyType(3, 4)\n# Notice that these are different objects, even though they are the same type!\na == b\n\nYou can see that a and b are both instances of the MyType class by using the type function.\n\ntype(a)\n\nPoint at the debugger to see the a.x etc. fields You can access the attributes of an object using the dot notation. For example, to access the x attribute of the a object, you would use a.x.\n\nprint(f\"a.x = {a.x} and a.y = {a.y}\")\n\nIn addition to attributes, objects can also have methods. Methods are functions that are defined inside of a class. They are accessed using the dot notation as well. For example, let’s define a method that adds the x and y attributes of an object.\n\nclass MyAdder:\n  def __init__(self, x, y):\n    self.x = x\n    self.y = y\n\n  def add(self):\n    return self.x + self.y\n\nWe can now create an object of type MyAdder and call the add method, in the same way that we called methods on built-in types (like the .upper() method on a string.)\n\nb = MyAdder(1, 2)\nprint(b.add())\n\nUsing custom classes can often be a helpful way to organize your code and make it more modular, by grouping together related variables and functions. Understanding how to create and use custom classes is also a key part of understanding how Python works under the hood, and can be crucial to using some of the more advanced Python packages (like PyTorch.)\n\n\nExercise\nSee exercise 5 in the exercise list."

    "text": "More on Scope (Optional)\nKeep in mind that with mathematical functions, the arguments are just dummy names that can be interchanged.\nThat is, the following are identical.\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n    f(K, L) &= z\\, K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}\\\\\n    f(K_2, L_2) &= z\\, K_2^{\\alpha} L_2^{1-\\alpha}\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\]\nThe same concept applies to Python functions, where the arguments are just placeholder names, and our cobb_douglas function is identical to\n\ndef cobb_douglas2(K2, L2): # changed dummy variable names\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n    alpha = 0.33\n\n    return z * K2**alpha * L2**(1 - alpha)\n\ncobb_douglas2(1.0, 0.5)\n\nThis is an appealing feature of functions for avoiding coding errors: names of variables within the function are localized and won’t clash with those on the outside (with more examples in scope).\nImportantly, when Python looks for variables matching a particular name, it begins in the most local scope.\nThat is, note that having an alpha in the outer scope does not impact the local one.\n\ndef cobb_douglas3(K, L, alpha): # added new argument\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha) # sees local argument alpha\n\nprint(cobb_douglas3(1.0, 0.5, 0.2))\nprint(\"Setting alpha, does the result change?\")\nalpha = 0.5 # in the outer scope\nprint(cobb_douglas3(1.0, 0.5, 0.2))\n\nA crucial element of the above function is that the alpha variable was available in the local scope of the function.\nConsider the alternative where it is not. We have removed the alpha function parameter as well as the local definition of alpha.\n\ndef cobb_douglas4(K, L): # added new argument\n\n    # Create alpha and z\n    z = 1\n\n    # there are no local alpha in scope!\n    return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\nalpha = 0.2 # in the outer scope\nprint(f\"alpha = {alpha} gives {cobb_douglas4(1.0, 0.5)}\")\nalpha = 0.3\nprint(f\"alpha = {alpha} gives {cobb_douglas4(1.0, 0.5)}\")\n\nThe intuition of scoping does not apply only for the “global” vs. “function” naming of variables, but also for nesting.\nFor example, we can define a version of cobb_douglas which is also missing a z in its inner-most scope, then put the function inside of another function.\n\nz = 1\ndef output_given_alpha(alpha):\n    # Scoping logic:\n    # 1. local function name doesn't clash with global one\n    # 2. alpha comes from the function parameter\n    # 3. z comes from the outer global scope\n    def cobb_douglas(K, L):\n        return z * K**alpha * L**(1 - alpha)\n\n    # using this function\n    return cobb_douglas(1.0, 0.5)\n\nalpha = 100 # ignored\nalphas = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]\n# comprehension variables also have local scope\n# and don't clash with the alpha = 100\n[output_given_alpha(alpha) for alpha in alphas]"
