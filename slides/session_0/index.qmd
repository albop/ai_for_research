## Introduction


Have you heard of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4) ?

. . .

<iframe src="https://share.descript.com/embed/hRYopxEmErc?transcript=false" width="1200" height="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Questions?

- What is the difference between GPT and ChatGPT?
- How is it related to other AI fields
  - like machine learning? more precisely Natural Language Processing (aka NLP)?
  - What are some other applications of generative AI?
- Can it be used for research? For which tasks?
- What should you pay attention to?
- How will it evolve?


## Roadmap

::: {#sample-listings}

:::

<!-- why to I get "No matching item ? -->

## Coursework

1. Homework
    a) read papers for next session (if any)
    b) do the pushups on Nuvolos, send to me

2. Projects
    a) replicate a text analysis paper using gpt
    b) present a study about biases of AI (last session)

. . .

Grading?

-  Fully discretionary

## Practicalities

- [Nuvolos](https://nuvolos.cloud/):
  - online computational platform with full python stack
  - full access during the course
  - _login with your (escp) gmail account_
  - send the homework through nuvolos

- Local setup:
  - Conda / Python
  - VSCode + Python extension

- OpenAI:
  - you will need a paid subscription

## Random Remarks

::: {.incremental}

How do Phd learn?

- by reading
- by doing
- by sitting/listening to a course
- by ~~pestering~~ asking ~~their PhD adviser~~ any professor

We are here to *exchange*

- you have a cool/useful application of AI?
  - show and share
- specific research ideas you would like to discuss?
- speak up

## Why Should you learn programming ?

::: {.incremental}

- Researchers (econometricians or data scientists) spend 80% of their time writing code.
- Presentation (plots, interactive apps) is key and relies on

    - ... programming

-  Interaction with code becomes unavoidable in business environment

    - fixing the website
    - querying the database
    - ...

- Worth investing a  bit of time to learn it

  - you can easily become an __expert__

- Plus it's fun

## Programming resources

Plenty of online resources to learn python/econometrics/machine learning

- [learnpython](learnpython.org) sponsored by [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/): by Jake Van der Plas, very complete. Online free version.
- [Introduction to Econometrics with R](https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics/), in R but very clear (beginner and advanced versions)

![](qe-logo-large.png)

- __Quantecon__: free online [lectures](https://quantecon.org/lectures/) to learn python programming and (advanced) economics
  - now with a section on [datascience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/)
  - it is excellent!
  - we will use some of it today
